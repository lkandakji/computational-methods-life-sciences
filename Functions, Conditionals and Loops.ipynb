    "## Linkage Disequilibrium\n",
    "In population genetics, Linkage Disequilibirium (LD) is a measure of deviation of allele frequencies at different loci, from random association. \n",
    "Loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when the alleles at two different loci are more likely (of less likely) to be observed together, than what would be expected by chance. There are different measures of LD. In this exercise you will write functions that caluclate LD (given the frequenices).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose at two different loci, there are two possible alleles, A/a and B/b corresponding to the first and second locus respectively. Let `pA` to denote the frequency of allele `A` at the first locus, and `pB` to represent the frequency of the `B` allele and `pAB` to be the frequency of `AB` combination in the population.\n",
