background: phenome-wide association studies (phewas) are a high-throughput approach to evaluate comprehensive associations between genetic variants a wide range of phenotypic measures.
phewas has varying sample sizes  quantitative traits, variable numbers of cases controls  binary traits across  many phenotypes of interest, which can affect  statistical power to detect associations.
  motivation of study is to investigate  various parameters which affect  estimation of statistical power phewas, including sample size, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, disease penetrance.
results: we performed a phewas simulation study, where we investigated variations statistical power based on different parameters, such as overall sample size, number of cases, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, disease penetrance.
 simulation was performed on both binary quantitative phenotypic measures.
our simulation on binary traits suggests  number of cases has more impact than  case to control ratio; also, we found a sample size of 200 cases more maintains  statistical power to identify associations  common variants.
 quantitative traits, a sample size of 1000 more individuals performed best  power calculations. we focused on common genetic variants (maf>0.01) study; however, future studies, we will be extending effort to perform similar simulations on rare variants. conclusions: study provides a series of phewas simulation analyses can be used to estimate statistical power  some potential scenarios. these results can be used to provide guidelines  appropriate study design  future phewas analyses.
